// "Look through" for the selected animal: trees, shrubs and buildings standing between the
// camera and the animal part like a gap in the canopy, so it stays visible behind cover and the
// view reads as peering down into the forest rather than through a hole punched in it:
//  - the edge is ragged, following leaf clumps (world-space noise) instead of a clean circle,
//    and the leaves along it stir with the wind;
//  - the opening flares toward the camera, a funnel, so the canopy layers step back one behind
//    another down to the animal;
//  - foliage lining the funnel is shaded, darker the deeper it sits, like the inside of a crown;
//    the ground, animal and surrounding landscape keep their normal light;
//  - shrubs, groundcover and litter on the floor stay, whole, where they show below the animal's
//    feet or beside it on screen, so the floor of the gap isn't bare;
//  - a tree trunk (or snag, stump, post) standing clear to the left or right of the animal on
//    screen stays too, so the forest around it doesn't read as cleared.
// It opens and closes by growing and shrinking, and follows the animal smoothly (see
// Renderer.updateFocus). Only what sits in front of the animal along the line of sight is
// affected, and only while an animal is selected. Fragments are discarded (a crisp edge, no
// dithering), so there is no transparency to depth-sort.
